# Progress.Scrollbar

`<Progress.Scrollbar>` is used to display the scrolling progress of the page.

It is fixed at the top of the page by default.

<Canvas
  of={Stories.Default}
  sourceState="hidden"
  source={{
    code: [
      'import { Progress, Typography } from "venomous-ui-react/components";',
      "",
      "function App() {",
      "  return (",
      "    <>",
      "      <Progress.Scrollbar />",
      "",
      '      <Typography.Paragraph style={{ height: "100vh" }}>',
      "        Please scroll the page",
      "      </Typography.Paragraph>",
      "  );",
      "}",
    ].join("\n"),
  }}
/>

<Controls />

## TroubleShotting

<br />

#### The bar always show 100% progress status

When using `<Progress.Scrollbar>` pages should ideally have a more than 100vh height, otherwise they will be treated as "already scrolled to the bottom".
