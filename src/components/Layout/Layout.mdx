# Layout

The layout of a page can be achieved quickly by combining these components, but they must be wrapped with `<Layout.Provider>`

- `<Layout.Header>` will be rendered as HTML tag `<header>`.
- `<Layout.Content>` will be rendered as HTML tag `<main>`.
- `<Layout.Side>` will be rendered as HTML tag `<aside>`.
- `<Layout.footer>` will be rendered as HTML tag `<footer>`.

## TroubleShotting

<br />

#### The Layout doesn't fixed, when pulling down the page, the entire layout scrolled together

Pulling down the page will triggers the **pull-to-refresh** feature. It's normal browser behavior, not an issue with layout components. But you can disable this behavior by using the following CSS:

```css
html,
body {
  height: 100svh;

  /* disable overscroll and pull-to-refresh */
  overscroll-behavior: none;
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}
```
