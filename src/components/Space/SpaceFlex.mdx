# Space.Flex

`<Space.Flex>` is used for flex layout, which simplifies the in-line style.

Of course the flex layout can still be precisely controlled by the `style` attribute.

<Canvas of={Stories.Default} sourceState="hidden" />

<Controls />

It is necessary to manually add `style={{ flex: 1 }}` or `style={{ width: "100%" }}` to all child elements within `<Space.Flex>`.
