## TroubleShotting

<br />

#### When used in deeply nested child components, its `position` is not based on the entire page, but on the current element.

The default `position` of a `<Modal>` is based on the most recently nested `relative` element. In deeply nested components, it is recommended to use `<Portal.Render>`.

```tsx
<Portal.Render targetElementID="root">
  <Modal {...props} />
</Portal.Render>
```
